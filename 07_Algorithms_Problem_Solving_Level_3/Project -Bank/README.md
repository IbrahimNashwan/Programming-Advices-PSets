# Client Management System in C++

A simple yet functional **Client Management System** built with C++ and file handling techniques. It provides a console-based user interface for managing clients, including operations like adding, updating, deleting, and searching for clients, as well as handling basic financial transactions.

- ✅ List all clients in a well-formatted table.
- ✅ Deposit and withdraw operations with balance validation.
- ✅ Show total balance across all clients.
